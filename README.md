This is personally one of my favorite side projects that I have done. I've loved making hacks for games and also reverse engineering them at an early age. This was an excellent project for me to finally put my skills to the test and branch on to different types of games. Previously, I had hacked flash games and then later on, native games such as CS GO. However, I had never hacked Unity games so I decided it would be a good challenge.

In order to reverse engineer this game, I needed advanced proficiency in many reverse engineering tools and programming languages. 
Some of the tools that I had used for this project was il2cppdumper, il2cppinspector, dnSpy, Cheat Engine, and IDA PRO. 
This game also required me to learn x64 trampoline hooking, function calling, and function hooking (__fastcall). 
Other hacking methods were also used such as finding breakpoints to see where function calls were taking place and byte patching, JMP patching, etc. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for any bans that happen when using this tool. This tool does not give an advantage in PVP (player vs player) game mode and is only useful for solo mode/campaign mode. 
I am also not releasing the source code as this code in the wrong hands could potentially be modified for PVP use as well. Thanks for reading.
